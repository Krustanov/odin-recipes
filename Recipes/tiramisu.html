    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large egg yolks, cold</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons rum</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>250 grams mascarpone cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream, cold</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups brewed coffee, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/4 cup rum</li>
            <li>1 pack ladyfingers</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cocoa powder</li>
            <li>shaved dark chocolate</li>    
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make an ice bath by filling a large mixing bowl with ice cubes and a little water.</li>
            <li>In a medium heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, alcohol, and salt. Set the bowl over a small saucepan of simmering water, making sure the bowl isn’t touching the water. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture lightens in color and thickens in texture, about 6 to 7 minutes. Carefully remove the hot bowl from the pot and place into the ice bath, being careful not to splash water inside. Let cool completely, whisking occasionally. Mixture will thicken as it cools.</li>
            <li>While the mixture cools, combine the mascarpone, heavy cream, and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat until medium peaks form. Gently fold the cooled egg yolk mixture into the whipped cream mixture until just combined.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the coffee and alcohol. Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the mixture (don’t allow to soak) then place in an even layer on the bottom of an 8 by 8-inch baking dish. Push in and break up any ladyfingers as necessary to create an even layer.</li>
            <li>Spoon half of the filling mixture across the ladyfingers, smoothing with a spatula. Repeat with a second layer of ladyfingers and remaining mascarpone cream.</li>
            <li>Cover and chill for at least 8 hours but preferably overnight.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, dust the tiramisu with cocoa powder. Sprinkle with chocolate shavings. Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 2 days.</li>
        </ol>
